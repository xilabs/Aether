Project Aether
======

Definitions: 
Aether Engine:  A realtime soft simulation of physical interactions between "atoms"
Atoms:          Smalles unit of simulated matter, often refered to as a voxel.

The Aether Engine represents the future of simulated reality.  As computers continue to improve in computational power, less corners need to be cut in pursuit of VR.  We believe that voxel based physics engines or "atom" engines might next evolution in immersive gaming.

Simulation

What do we want to simulate?  Concrete hit by a hammer?
